NFL Roster












When the add button is pressed, it should automatically add a player to the Roster.
Create a constructor for Player that accepts 3 arguments, Name, Position, Number.
When the Add button is pressed, a new player is created and added to the Players array.
Use JQuery to target the "player-roster" div, and append the player.

As a FAN of sports, I would like a dynamic roster where I can add/remove players from the list. So that I can visualize my sports team.

I would like a form so that I can add a player to my roster easily.
The form should have the following fields
Player Name
Player Position
Player Number
I would like the players added to show up in the roster section after being added.
